# This is a comment
# Do not explain obvious things with comments
# Codes should most of the time not be changed everytime code is changed

# Example bad comment: prints sky is blue
print('Sky is not blue')

# Another bad example
# Calculates and returns the square of a number
def square(number):
    return number*number

# This creates noise. It is repetitive.

# Use comments to explain hows
